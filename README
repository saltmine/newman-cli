Newman
======

Newman helps create CLI tools for raw python functions. It makes it easy to
enumerate which functions you want exposed to the CLI, and does a bit of
magic to dedude proper signatures for python functions that map well to the
CLI.

You would take newman as a dependency of your project if you want to avoid
the boilerplate of making new CLI entry-points for small bits of python. It
supports a wide range of sane defaults, and builds nested documentation based
on the docstrings of exposed functions.
